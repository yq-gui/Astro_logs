by **Jiaxin Tang and Qiyue Qian**
- Motivation
    - magnatic monopole
- Constrains (Neronov&Vovk 2010)
    - Zeeman effect - direct measurement
    - CMB - primodrdial magnetic field effecting CMD
    - Faraday rotation - rotation of a polariztation plane
    - BBN - cosmic expansion rate
    - Blazar - non-detection measurement
- Cosmic void
    - small-scale magnetic has no memory
- Theory
    - Dynamo theory
        - seed magnetic field (may due to small scale)
        - usually $\mu$G to mG
        - strong correlation betweeen galaxy radio and infrared radiation
    - Primodial magnetic field theory
        - assuming uniform weak magnetic field (starting from the big bang), only amplified from the distortion
        - theoretically is 10^-7 G, but observation is 10^-6 G (primordial B has to be at least 10^-18 G)
        - supports
            - deflection of gamma ray
- prediction
    - dynamo - even parity, primordial B - Odd parity
    - Galacic scale? Cosmic Scale? 
- Observation
    - methods
        - synchrotron emission
            - decompose thermal& synchrotron in spectra
        - faraday rotation
            - rotation related to frequencies
            - cum for electron density
        - zeeman effect
    - most are by synchrotron emission and faraday rotation
        - instruments
            - radio: LOFAR, FAST, VLA, Arecibo, GBT
        - Galaxy 
            - typical strength 1-10$\mu$G

### 10.25 - Mean motion resonances in planetary system
by **Sijia Cai, Haibing Ren and Zhecheng Hu**
##### Resonances
- Resonances in solar system
    - neptum and pluto : 3:2
    - Asteroid main-belt distribution : influenced by Jupiter
- mean motion resonance
    - definition: n = 2\pi/P
    - n1/n2 = (j+o) /j, j is resonance order
        - e.g. 2:1 are 1st order
    - resonance angle
        - $\phi_{res} = (j+o)\lambda_2-j\lambda_1-\omega$
        - resonance angle fixed or variate in small range : resonant
    - resonance strength $\propto e^{order}$, so lower order are more common (espcially at low eccentricity)
- resonances in exoplanet systems
    - Methodology
        - Kepler: 150k stars
        - TESS: 400 times larger than Kepler
    - silghtly off-resonant pairs in observations
        - explaination: see below
- resonances form in protoplanetary disk
    - obrit migration leads to capture/break resonance
        - tidal dampling
        - disk migration
##### Convergent Migration -- Mean Motion Resonace Capture
- planet in protoplanetary disk
    - Cloud collapse -- star (Jeans instability)
    - Migration in disk
        - Type I: the small planet diesn't open a gap
        - Type II: massive planet and will open a gap
        - Type III: run away migration
    - Lindblad torque
            - Lindblad resonance for Keplerian disk
            - the outer torque is closer and negative: dominate
        - Corotation torque
            - positive torque dominate
        Usually Lindblad torque > Corotation torque, so planet rotates inward
    - convergent migration

##### Breaks the chains -- from resonant chains to keplerian planets
- why are  many planet systems not resonant?
    - 1st order resonance occur just 15%
    - Break-the-Chains model
        - resonant chain forming is universal, however multi-planet systems themselves are not always stable due to orbital crossing
        - bimodel distribution: **one or many** planets in a planet system
- when are planet systems not resonant?
    - <0.1Gyr: 80% pairs is resonant
    - $>$1Gyr : only <30%
    ==> ~Gyr
- How do planet systems become not resonant?
    - mass loss of atmosphere: photoevaporation due to XUV heating by stars
    - born with instability

##### using BAO dark energy properties
- BAO: peaked at 150 Mpc
- spectroscopic sky survey - redshift and celestial coordiants
- How does BAO constrains cosmological parameters?
    - $D_M(z) = \theta_{BAO} * r_d$
    - $r_d = c\delta z_{BAO}/H(z)$, $D_H = c/H(z)$ ==> $\delta z_{BAO} = r_d / D_H(z)$

    - define scaling parameters $\alpha_{||}= \frac{D_H(z)/r_d}{D_H^{fid}(z)/r^{fid}_d}$,$\alpha_{\perp}= \frac{D_M(z)/r_d}{D_M^{fid}(z)/r^{fid}_d}$
    - observables: BAO monople $\alpha_{iso} = (\alpha_{\perp}^2\alpha_{||})^{1/3}$ and BAO quadraple $\alpha_{AP} = \alpha_{\perp}/\alpha_{||}$
    ==> $\frac{H(z)}{H_0}$

        - High-energy charged particles
        - typical energy ~1GeV - relativistic
        - energy density ~ 1eV cm^{-3} - equipatitionn with other component with ISM
    - CR feedback
        - CRs longer cooling time to Radiation pressure
            - missing baryon problem
        - many uncertainties
    - ISM environment
        - ISM: plasma + B field
- Microphysical basis
    - Alfven wave
        - B field has tension, like string
        - alfven velocity : B field tension + plasma inertia
    - CRs can excite and scattered by Alfven wave
        - Alfven wave: $v_\perp$ 
        - B field: $\delta B$
        - Lorentz force: $v_\perp$ cross $\delta B$ always anti-direction with $v_{||}$ 
    - Gyroresonance
        - $v_\perp$ and $\delta B$ rotate in same direction
    - total results: wave-particle interaction
        - CRs lose/gain energy
        - isotropization: due to random walk 
        - self-confinement : $v_{CR} \sim 10\ km\ c^{-1} \ll c$
    - energy deposition: CRs energy will not be infinite
        - wave loses energy to plasma
        - if weak damping and large CR gradient, CR stronger
- Macrophysical outcome
    - wind

        - CR stable or unstable: hydrostatic equilibrium
        - Streaming, scattering, constant
