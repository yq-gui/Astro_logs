##### [Virgo Filaments. III. The gas content of galaxies in filaments as predicted by the GAEA semi-analytic model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17367)

- Compare **observational data** (catalogue of galaxies in the Virgo cluster) with GAEA semi-analytic model.
- 'Introduction' gives clear picture of the relation between galaxy assembly and large-scale environment/structure.
- Fig4. shows **positive** relation between M_HI and stellar mass color coded by sSFR in different environment(cluster/filament/field), and finds the fraction of low HI-content galaxies **decreases** from clusters to filaments to pure fields. GAEA can reproduce them.
- Fig4. & Fig5. give a **correlation** between H2-deficiency and HI-deficiency for each environment and mass bin. And HI is **more sensitive** to the environment than H2.

- 问题：
    1. In filaments, there're group galaxies and pure filament galaxies. What's the difference?
    2. Only relations between cold gas(HI/H2) and LSS. What about SFR/stellar mass?

##### [Magnetising galaxies with cold inflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17438)
- Estimate the magnetisation of high-redshift(z ∼ 2−3)  galaxies using a simple analytic model, and how does the magnetic field corelate with cold inflowing streams.
- **Fig. 3.**!
- Predict a very fast magnetisation (probably due to cold streams emerge) of the galaxy (10 Myr) which is consistent with the observed galaxy by Geach et al. (2023).

##### [The diverse star formation histories of early massive, quenched galaxies in modern galaxy formation simulations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16916)
- study of the star formation histories of **massive-quenched** galaxies at 𝑧 = 3
- methodology: simulation(compare 3 semi-analytic models **Shark, GAEA, Galform** and 3 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations **Eagle, Illustris-TNG, Simba**)
    - Semi-analytic models
        - properties
            1. DM-only 𝑁-body simulations
            2. have dark matter (DM) halo populations and merger trees
            3. sensitive to the number of snapshots produced with the 𝑁-body simulation (hydro don't)
        - examples

- Difference between these simulations
    - due to  **AGN feedback model**
    - hard to determine by observation(small scale)
- JWST found more massive and passive galaixes than before
