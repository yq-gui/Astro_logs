##### [Virgo Filaments. III. The gas content of galaxies in filaments as predicted by the GAEA semi-analytic model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17367)

- Compare **observational data** (catalogue of galaxies in the Virgo cluster) with GAEA semi-analytic model.
- 'Introduction' gives clear picture of the relation between galaxy assembly and large-scale environment/structure.
- Fig4. shows **positive** relation between M_HI and stellar mass color coded by sSFR in different environment(cluster/filament/field), and finds the fraction of low HI-content galaxies **decreases** from clusters to filaments to pure fields. GAEA can reproduce them.
- Fig4. & Fig5. give a **correlation** between H2-deficiency and HI-deficiency for each environment and mass bin. And HI is **more sensitive** to the environment than H2.

- ÈóÆÈ¢òÔºö
    1. In filaments, there're group galaxies and pure filament galaxies. What's the difference?
    2. Only relations between cold gas(HI/H2) and LSS. What about SFR/stellar mass?

##### [Magnetising galaxies with cold inflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17438)
- Estimate the magnetisation of high-redshift(z ‚àº 2‚àí3)  galaxies using a simple analytic model, and how does the magnetic field corelate with cold inflowing streams.
- **Fig. 3.**!
- Predict a very fast magnetisation (probably due to cold streams emerge) of the galaxy (10 Myr) which is consistent with the observed galaxy by Geach et al. (2023).

##### [ON THE ELEVATION AND SUPPRESSION OF STAR FORMATION WITHIN GALAXIES](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10276)
(Enci Wang et al.)
- Motivation
- Method
    - a well-defined sample of 976 star-forming MaNGA galaxies
- Results
    - Enhanced and Suppressed star forming galaxies show similar increase/decrease of SFR surface density at the central region.
    - Lower depletion time at the central region results in large uncertainties of central SFR among a sample of galaxies.

##### [Star Formation and Quenching of Central Galaxies from Stacked HI Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13505)
(Hong Guo et al.)
- Study the dependence of HI mass on stellar mass, halo mass, SFR and $\Sigma_1$ (stellar surface density within 1kpc). **compaction quenching **
- Similar shapes of $M_{\rm HI}$-$M_\ast$ and $M_{\rm HI}$-M_halo, showing the direct driver of quenching is the depletion of HI resevior and stellar/halo masses influence indirectly.
- **Rejuvenation** NOT Fig.3 as noted in the paper, but from right panel in Fig.4. For low-$M_\ast$ galaxies, SFR increases with $M_{\rm HI}$, meaning that these galaxies will return back to SFMS with the supplement of new HI gas. This is the "rejuvenation". For high-$M_\ast$ galaxies, the dependence of SFR on $M_{\rm HI}$ is weak, which means they are hard to get back to SF even with new gas, and the quenching of them can also be regulated by other processes.

(David Vall√©s-P√©rez et al.)
- Propose the "plane" relation among halo mass M_h, shock radius R_sh and shock Mach number M to constrain (DM) mass to an error ~30%.
- The accretion shock of clusters located at ~ 2-3 virial radius R_vir is anticipated to be observed in the future X-ray and radio observations.

##### [Gas-phase Metallicity as a Diagnostic of the Drivers of Star-formation on Different Spatial Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01935)
(Enci Wang & Simon John Lilly)
- Fundamental relation between stellar mass, gas metallicity (traced by O/H), star formation rate.
- Changing gas inflow leads to an inverse proportional relation between SFR and log(O/H), while star formation efficiency (SFE) gives a proportional relation.
- 100pc-scale IFU observations from MAD shows a proportional relation while an inversely proportional relation from galaxy-scale observations in MaNGA. This indicates the small-scale SFR is regulated by varying SFE and the galaxy-scale one by supplement of gas.

##### [The origin of scatter in the star formation rate - stellar mass relation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.05956)
(Jorryt Matthee & Joop Schaye)
- Using EAGLE simulation to study the mass dependence, evolution and origin of scatter in the star formation rate.
- The scatter at z = 0.1 originates from a combination of fluctuations on short time-scales (ranging from 0.2-2 Gyr) associated with self-regulation from cooling, star formation and outflows and long time-scale (‚àº 10 Gyr) variations related to differences in halo formation times.

(Victoria Willianmson et al.)
- Theoretically using 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) to capture the non-Gaussian correlation from the highly non-linear turbulence of ISM. 
- Simulations show magnetic field leads to parity-odd modes of the 4PCF which can be a clean test in the observational ramifications.

##### [The Formation of Star-forming Disks in the TNG50 Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03967)
(Enci Wang et al.)
- **EAGLE/IllustrisTNG successfully reproduce many observational facts about the galaxy population, including galaxy color bimodality, cold gas fraction, statistical properties of galaxy morphology, etc.**
    - However, it is not clear whether these simulations are currently able to reproduce the detailed internal structure of galaxies.
- Main-sequence star-forming galaxies from TNG50 tend to have larger star-forming disks, which may due to  continuous gas accretion rather than the consumption of pre-existing gas in galaxies.
- The stellar surface density of TNG50 galaxies show good exponential profiles with the result of strong radial migration of stars, but it may not be realistic for real galaxies.
