## "Quest for the origin of Neutrino"
by **Benda XU from Department of Engineering Physics** in 9.26
- Neutrinos
    - Neutrinos are ubiquitous in nucleosynthesis
    - right handed neutrinos are missed
        - parity symmetry broken
        - Explained by Lee-Yang's two-componet Weyl-Fermion $\nu$ model
    - Solar, atmospheric and reactor neutrino - Non-zero $m_\nu$ can explain solar neutrino probelms
        - But how small is the $\nu$ mass?
        - $\nu$ with mass influence structure formation of the universe
    - Seesaw mechaism - minimal extension to the standard model
        - $\nu$ oscillation between 3 types
- JUNO
    - reactor $\nu$
    - expected to start in 2024
- JNE: Jinping Neutrino Experiment
    - natural $\nu$
    - Solar $\nu$, Geo-$\nu$, Supernova $\nu$
    - Cherenkov light, scintillation light
- Big physics and big data
    - MCMC

## "Probing the spacetime variation of the fine-structure constant"
by **Linhua Jiang from Peking University and KIAA** in 10.10

- Introduction
    - fundamental physical constants
    - fine-structure constant
        - strength of the electromagnetic interaction betwee n elementary charged particles
- Methodology
     - absorption lines of very bright quasars
     - AD method
     - many multiplet method
     - isotope effect limits the accuracy
     - [O III] doublet emission is best probe of varying $\alpha$
        - Pros
            - emission is easier to observe than absorption
            - wide line separation
            - less sensitive to absolute wavelengths than AD method
        - Cons
            - disturbed by H $\beta$ line
    - Sample
        - DESI DR1
        - JWST NIRSpec spectra strong [O III] emitters
- Spatial variation of $\alpha$
    - 6 subsamples in redshift
    - no large-scale structrres of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$
- JWST
    - wavelength calibration
        - absolut: emission lines with ground-based observations
        - relative calibration : spectra with two or more strong emission mines
