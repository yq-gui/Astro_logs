            - wide line separation
            - less sensitive to absolute wavelengths than AD method

        - JWST NIRSpec spectra strong [O III] emitters
- Spatial variation of $\alpha$
    - 6 subsamples in redshift
    - no large-scale structrres of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$

#### "Stellar physics and population in the open cluster lab"
by **Xiaoting FU 符晓婷 from PMO紫台** in 10.24
- The galacitc open clusters
    - stars
        - stellar structure (L,T,R,g,M,age,abun.,struc.)
        - stellar atmosphere model (mag, flux)
    - star clusters
        - stars + IMF -- simple stellar population
    - the galactic evolution
        - simple stellar population + SFH -- galactic stellar population
- Open cluster lab
    - probe the galactic evolution  
        - galactic metallcity gradient: metal distribution at different radii at different epoches
            - MW: turning point at ~11kpc: within decreases fast and outer decreases slowly
            - instead of radii, **angular momentum/dynamical energy** is more important. Because orbits of open cluster are usually not circle but ellipse
        - Dynamical orgin of open clusters
            - different from globular clusters(has negative Lz)
            - open cluster: Lz>0, from a plane between Energy - Lz
        - Gas cloud metallicity gradient
            - young OCs: the link between gas and stars
            - open clusters near in space have different [Fe/H]: may due to that gas is not homogeneous
            - young clusters are more metal-poor, with spatial dependence
    - constrain stellar model
        - CMD fitting problem
            - inaccuracy in cluster age
            - using empirical color correction in CMD fitting
    - calibrate stellar paramiters
        - stellar parameters
    - unknown issues to be explored
        - missing open clusters in the outer disk
            - no observatble stars? (Top-heavy/bottom-heavy IMF)
            - Terminated star formation (Merger crime)
            - Ineffient star formation (ISM turbulence/magnatic field)

    - star formation : multi-scale, multi-physics, multi-wavelength
        - is it all this way?
        - what are the physical condition in early universe?
    - The GCs in MW
        - most formed z= 4-10
    - 2 facts for GC:
        - formation
            - turbulence in proto-galaxies (we don't know much about it)
            - formation at low metallicity (hard to cool)
            - clustered star formtation
            - varying IMF

        - however: current status: data is not incompatible. Maybe no cut off
    - cluster to galaxy scaling relations
        - Before: Cluster mass $M_C$ $\propto$ $\Sigma_{SFR}$
        - but $M_C$ is local, and $\Sigma_{SFR}$ is globale
        - different physical triggers will have different unstable scales
        - new obs has found many outliers
    - cluster formation efficency
        - CFR/SFR v.s. $\Sigma_{SFR}$
        - maybe two regions
- Simulation
    - SFE
        - Higher SFE, lower CFE (CFR divided by gas property)
        - Higher SFE, higher CFR/SFR
    - feedback
        - has sub-grid recipes
    - problem of simu
        - routines: stellar evolution -> gas removal by feedback -> lowering of potential -> cluster expansion ->
            - -> gas-free cluseter
            - -> cluster dissolution
        - turbulence, tides, shear, external radiation ... depend on environmnet and redshift
- tides and mass loss
    - tides are weaker in young galaxies with rapid variations
    - cluseter mass-loss on the galactic host but large scatter
    - relation
        - halo mass v.s. mass of GC
        - mass of GC: merger+starburst+tides
