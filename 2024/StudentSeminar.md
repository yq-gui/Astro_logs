    - star-forming?
        - No UV emission detection -- 2 sigma upper limit on SFR

## 10.18 - Cosmic magnatic field
by **Jiaxin Tang and Qiyue Qian**
- Motivation
    - magnatic monopole
- Constrains (Neronov&Vovk 2010)
    - Zeeman effect - direct measurement
    - CMB - primodrdial magnetic field effecting CMD
    - Faraday rotation - rotation of a polariztation plane
    - BBN - cosmic expansion rate
    - Blazar - non-detection measurement
- Cosmic void
    - small-scale magnetic has no memory
- Theory
    - Dynamo theory
        - seed magnetic field (may due to small scale)
        - usually $\mu$G to mG
        - strong correlation betweeen galaxy radio and infrared radiation
    - Primodial magnetic field theory
        - assuming uniform weak magnetic field (starting from the big bang), only amplified from the distortion
        - theoretically is 10^-7 G, but observation is 10^-6 G (primordial B has to be at least 10^-18 G)
        - supports
            - deflection of gamma ray
- prediction
    - dynamo - even parity, primordial B - Odd parity
    - Galacic scale? Cosmic Scale?
